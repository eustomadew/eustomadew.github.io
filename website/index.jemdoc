# # I am currently a postdoctoral research fellow at the College of Design & Engineering, National University of Singapore (NUS). Prior to joining NUS, 
# I am currently a MSCA postdoc at the Department of Computer Science, University of Copenhagen (UCPH). Prior to joining UCPH, I was a postdoctoral research fellow at the National University of Singapore. I obtained my Ph.D. degree from the Department of Computer Science and Technology, University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), and was very fortunate to be supervised by Prof. [http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~hchen/ Huanhuan Chen]. I was a visiting research student once with the DATA Lab, Department of Computer Science & Engineering, Texas A&M University. Before that, I received my Bachelor’s degree from the College of Science, Northwest A&F University (NWAFU). 
# I am also a member of the [https://sites.google.com/diku.edu/delta DeLTA lab]. 

I am currently a MSCA postdoc advised by Prof. [https://sites.google.com/site/yevgenyseldin Yevgeny Seldin] at the Department of Computer Science, University of Copenhagen (UCPH), funded by the European Union (the [https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101106768/program/43108390/details FairML] project, and [https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101106768 CORDIS]). I obtained my Ph.D. degree from the Department of Computer Science and Technology, University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), and was very fortunate to be supervised by Prof. [http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~hchen/ Huanhuan Chen]. 
My research interests span the areas of machine learning, ensemble methods, and fairness in machine learning.
